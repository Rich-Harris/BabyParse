# Deprecated in favour of [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com)

## This was a Node-friendly fork of Papa Parse. Since Papa Parse now supports Node directly, you should use that instead.

Baby Parse
=========

BabyParse was a port of [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com) for Node.js.

Latests Paparse versions works correctly on Node, so we recomend using Paparse directly instead of BabyParse.
